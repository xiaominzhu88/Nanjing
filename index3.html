                    In first year of Jianwu reign
                    of Jin Dynasty (CE 317), Nanjing Imperial University was founded,
                    initially on northern bank of Qinhuai River, and in the 3rd year of Xiankang (CE 337) the campus
                    extended to southern bank.
                    In the 1st year of Jingyou during Song Dynasty (CE 1034),
                    Confucius Temple was newly constructed on former site of imperial university, and was called
                    Fuzimiao
                    area along with Nanjing Fuxue.
                    The place became Imperial University again in 1365 in the early year of Ming Dynasty, and sixteen
                    years
                    later recovered to be the campus of Fuxue.
                    During Qing Dynasty, there were two Xianxue (county schools of Shangyuan and Jiangning) in Fuzimiao
                    area.
                    In the end of Qing a primary school jointly sponsored by counties of Nanjing (Jiangning Fu) was
                    established there.
                    The current buildings date from the 19th century, in Qing Dynasty, with additions made since then.
                    During the late 1920s to 1931 and again in 1932 it was used as army barracks for troops the KMT
                    regime

                <p><img src="nanjingyan.jpeg">Now we come to some modern buildings, Nanjing Eye is practically a bridge,
                    not a ferris-wheel like London Eye.
                    It is design like an eye. You can do jogging or small sports at park surrounding Nanjing Eye.
                    Nanjing Eye is inside the YOG boulevard, near to the Olympic Museum and Theater Center.
                    The boulevard is pretty quiet. If you like photography, you have to come here.
                    There is an observatory deck where you can take pic of whole bridge and river.
