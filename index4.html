            judging by the number of food stalls on one block and the ever-present aroma of duck soup through the city.

                These steamed dumplings are sublime. Under an extremely thin layer of dough hides a bomb of delectable
                broth and a ball of tender pork.

                To eat these jiggly meat pockets, bite a small “window”on the skin, drink up the
                broth, dip the rest in
                vinegar, then munch.</td>



            <td> A most classic Nanjing food. This cold dish exemplifies Nanjing chef’s unparalleled skills in cooking
                the fowl. The duck meat is well-seasoned, juicy and tender. Bones are easy to get rid of.

                To make the dish, free-range ducks are first simmered in brine, hung to dry for around three
                    days and
                then served as chops.</td>



            <td> Cubes of duck blood come with duck-bone stock with deep-fried firm tofu, vermicelli and bits of duck
                organs, such as liver and gizzard. The texture of the coagulated blood resembles bean curd: succulent,
                watery and tender.

                This soupy snack is a Nanjing food staple. Locals would order a bowl any time of the day.</td>

            <td>These small things, loaded with minced beef or pork mixing diced ginger and spring onion, are cooked
                until swim on the water.

                The fragrant crescents provide a contrasting taste sensation: the outside is so thin while
                the inside is moist and soft.</td>




            <td> Every autumn between mid-September and mid-October, fishermen throws a grand festival to celebrate the
                harvest season of the lake delicacies, the crabs will always only be a trouble because they are
                everywhere,
                so the people try to wipe out them.
                The local way to enjoy these crustaceans is to cook them with different chinese herbal medicines and
                seasonings.</td>






            <td> Oh! This is absolutly my favorite dessert.
                This traditional dessert is rich but not overly sweet. The glutinous soup is made with sugared red bean
                paste and pearls of soft dumplings.
                Osmanthus honey is mixed in at the end.

                It is a popular food in Nanjing and east China and carries the lucky meaning of “family reunion.”</td>
